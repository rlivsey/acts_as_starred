ActsAsStarred
=============

Dead simple starring of items - like GMail

Usage
=====

class YourModel < ActiveRecord::Base

	acts_as_starred

end

This gets you:

YourModel#star!
YourModel#unstar!
YourModel#starred_by?(user/user_id)
YourModel#starrings

That's all there is to it.

Assumptions
===========

It assumes that you are using this in conjunction with something like the userstamp plugin
which assigns the current logged in user to created_by fields.

DB Structure
============

Need to add migration generator, but for now just copy this to a migration and 
add any extra required fields

class CreateStarrings < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
    create_table :starrings do |t|
    	t.column :created_by, :integer
      t.column :created_on, :datetime
      t.column :item_id,    :integer
      t.column :item_type,  :string        
    end
  end

  def self.down
    drop_table :starrings
  end
end

Testing
=======

The tests use RSpec, so this needs to be installed in your rails app
